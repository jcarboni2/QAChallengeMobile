QA Challenge of Cabify

## Summary:

What is Price Calculator?
We want to help users to choose what kind of journey they want to do and how much this journey will cost. To do it, we want to provide users a new tool to calculate the price of a journey from the most common start points to the most common destination points and get the estimated price for the journey. Once you have the estimation, you can order a car or you can calculate a new journey.

The price for each user is unique and it depends from different things (#journeys for the user, mean journey time for this user, etc.). To do it, we show to the user a 3-number token that the user has to memorise and include in the estimation. The price for a journey depends on distance and vehicle type (Lite: standard price, Executive: 10% expensive about Lite price).
